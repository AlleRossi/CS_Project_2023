This project was made as part of the java OOP exam at UNIMORE university, MODENA, IT.
Thus the purpose of this repository is educational only, I don't own any rights regarding the game "PACMAN" nor the images used in this code

# new PacMan
this revisited version of the famous game "PACMAN" is set in the same maz-like environment as the actual game but in a new CTF (capture the flag) style.
the goal is to collect at least 2/3 of the possible coins before beaing able to collect the flag and escape the maze while getting chased down by the ghosts.

Enjoy.
