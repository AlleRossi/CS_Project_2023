# CS_Project_2023
This project was made as part of the java OOP exam at UNIMORE university, MODENA, IT.
Thus the purpose of this repository is educational only, I don't own any rights regarding the game "PACMAN" nor the images used in this code

## new PacMan
this revisited version of the famous game "PACMAN" is set in the same maze-like environment as the actual game but in a new CTF (capture the flag) style.
the goal is to collect at least 2/3 of the possible coins before being able to capture the flag and escape the maze while getting chased down by the ghosts.
to succeed you get three lives only, choose wisely how to spend them.

Enjoy.
