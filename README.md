# CS_Project_2023
This project was made as part of the java OOP exam at UNIMORE university, MODENA, IT.
Thus the purpose of this repository is educational only.
It is required of me to state that I don't own any rights regarding the actual game "PACMAN"
nor the images used in this code, all the rights reagarding the branding of the game and the images
are to be appointed to the respectful owners.

## new PacMan
this revisited version of the famous game "PACMAN" is set in the same maze-like environment as the actual game but in a new CTF (capture the flag) style.
the goal is to collect at least 2/3 of the possible coins before being able to capture the flag and escape the maze while getting chased down by the ghosts.
to succeed you get three lives only, choose wisely how to spend them.

Enjoy.
